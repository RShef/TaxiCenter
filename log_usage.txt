For logging in this program we used "easylogging++".
We used it to:
1. log every send and receive action on both the server and clients to make sure communication was correct (INFO)
2. log every movement of the driver on both the server and clients to make sure it was moving correctly (DEBUG)
3. log trips' route calculations (DEBUG)

Logger used 2 config files (for server and clients)
and wrote to 2 log files (for server and clients)

Logging was very helpful for debugging and finding exactly where the program was failing.
